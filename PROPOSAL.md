The objective of this project is to analyze the financial health and vulnerability of publicly traded companies by combining financial statement data with modern data science techniques. The goal is to design a rigorous analytical workflow that includes computing key financial indicators, exploring structural patterns in the data, and building predictive models capable of identifying firms at risk of financial distress or bankruptcy. This topic naturally aligns with the themes of the course, as it integrates statistical concepts, Python programming, and applied financial analysis.

The empirical analysis will focus on U.S. publicly listed firms, whose standardized reporting and extensive disclosures provide a reliable foundation for quantitative study. Financial data will be collected from online financial screeners, publicly available datasets, or from Refinitiv/Compustat. These sources offer detailed information on profitability, liquidity, leverage, solvency, and cash flows. When possible, the dataset will be enriched with complementary information such as historical bankruptcy events and macroeconomic variables (e.g., interest rates or GDP growth).

The methodology will rely on two main components. First, an exploratory data analysis will be conducted to understand the structure of the dataset, examine trends, and highlight potential relationships among financial variables. This includes computing KPIs such as return on assets (ROA), interest coverage ratios, debt ratios, current ratios, and sales growth.

Second, predictive models will be developed and evaluated. Depending on data availability, both regression and classification approaches will be used. Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or other machine learning algorithms may be considered. Model performance will be assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC–AUC. Comparing these models will provide insights into which techniques offer the most reliable predictive ability in the context of financial distress.

Finally, the interpretability of the results will be a central aspect of the project. Beyond achieving accurate predictions, the aim is to identify which financial indicators contribute most to firms' vulnerability, and to discuss the economic implications of these findings. This will help translate technical outputs into meaningful insights for investors, analysts, and financial managers.

Overall, the project aims to deliver a comprehensive integration of financial analysis and data science. While adjustments may be made depending on data quality and availability, the focus will remain on constructing a robust analytical framework that highlights the determinants of corporate financial distress and illustrates the predictive power of statistical learning methods.
